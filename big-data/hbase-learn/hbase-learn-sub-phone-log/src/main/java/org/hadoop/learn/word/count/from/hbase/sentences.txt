Apache HBase
Welcome to Apache HBase®
Apache HBase® is the Hadoop database, a distributed, scalable, big data store.

Use Apache HBase® when you need random, realtime read/write access to your Big Data. This project's goal is the hosting of very large tables -- billions of rows X millions of columns -- atop clusters of commodity hardware. Apache HBase® is an open-source, distributed, versioned, non-relational database modeled after Google's Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data by Chang et al. Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System, Apache HBase® provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of Hadoop and HDFS.
